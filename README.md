## Introduction

### Why this repo

Hi, as developers we want to be productive quickly. Strapi is an amazing framework for content management, and medusa is the new kid on the block, as an ecommerce engine. Combining the two definitely made sense. The last attempt to combine the two was with strapi v3, which has since been deprecated and strapi v4 is the new standard. 

#### V3 vs V4
To understand this you need a little bit of strapi background
Strapi uses a system of content schemas, unfortunately with a major version upgrade to v4 the old schemas are no longer effective. Moreover, you are unable to take advantage of strapis built in relationship system. In v3 you had to handle one  - many, one to one, many to one relationshs etc manually in your service code. In V4 strapi bakes this capability internally, freeing you from the need to maintain boiler plate code. This and several other enhancements made strapi v4 the true choice. 

In medusa terms, you can easily map a one to many relations between products and product variants in strapi just you do in medusa

#### Why a mono repo

Well the answer is simple, maintainability. Strapi's template based system well its useful but not 100%. I prefer having all the boiler plate code and features like multi langauage support, redis support, and whole bunch of other things baked into my code than having to install them one by one.
There are some closely related components, that though can be used separate from the repo, works best if everything is put together. 
Then the plugin to associate with medusa is closely related to the api structure, yet a different component. 

Moreover it made integration testing much easier. Testing was critical as the number of apis increase, but more on this later. 

## Monorepo organisation

This mono repo houses 5 components. All are under the packages folder. You can read more about the individual components there
1. [medusa-strapi](packages/medusa-strapi/README.md)            - the strapi implementation
2. [medusa-plugin-strapi-ts](packages/medusa-plugin-strapi-ts/README.md)  - the medusa plugin for strapi
3. [strapi-plugin-medusajs](packages/strapi-plugin-medusajs/README.md)   - the strapi plugin to ensure strapi runs as a slave to medusa
4. [strapi-plugin-sso-medusa](packages/strapi-plugin-sso-medusa/README.md) - the strapi plugin to help you can sign into strapi with medusa credentials
5. [strapi-plugin-multi-country-select](packages/strapi-plugin-multi-country-select/README.md) - this is a small admin tool to enable multiple countries to be selected. This was initially a separate repo, but now has been merged with this to ensure consistent builds.
